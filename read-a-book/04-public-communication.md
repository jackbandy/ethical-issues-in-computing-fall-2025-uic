# Public Communication (Your "Unessay")

Good job reading a book! This is the creative component of your "read a book" exercises, intended to help you digest what you read.

**Your Prompt:** Communicate one of the most important ideas from the book you just read *with a broader public.*

That's it. This is intentionally open-ended, and it will be helpful to consider *your own* strengths, talents, and skills, and how you might use them to communicate the idea.
If you are feeling stuck, here are some ideas (some from [Emily Clark](https://esclark.hcommons.org/the-unessay/)):
* a painting or drawing
* a ceramics project
* a 3-D and/or 2-D collage
* original song lyrics
* a standup comedy routine or monologue
* a music video or video essay
* a letter to an alderperson, mayor, senator, etc.
* a fitness routine
* a short story
* a website, web app, or mobile app
* a simple game

This is an opportunity, invitation, and encouragement to **practice your creativity.** It is an "unessay," not a normal essay!
A few other guidelines:
* It may be helpful to consider what you shared in your book report and/or what you will share in your peer presentation in class
  * This should not be a simple regurgitation of those materials
* The audience for your book report and your presentation included just your instructor and classmates.
* For this "public communication," your audience should be broader in some way (perhaps the broader student body, other residents of your town/neighborhood, etc.)

This is my first time assigning an unessay, so please email me (`jxb@uic.edu`) with your questions.

I learned about the unessay from [Emily Suzanne Clark](https://esclark.hcommons.org/the-unessay/), via [this list](https://against-a-i.com/assignment-ideas/) of AI-resistant assignment ideas.

# Book Presentation

You chose a book, and you chose a book you wanted to read! As we approach the end of the semester, it's time to share what you've learned with the class.

This will take the form of a ~10-minute presentation, as [scheduled here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FlONlnU9Dx2SlgFEHLl0qcOkbJElDrcBYJCm1qkRHXo/edit?usp=sharing).

Here are some guidelines for "one way to make a successful presentation," adapted from [Colorado State University](https://writing.colostate.edu/guides/teaching/e238/paex.cfm).
* **Talk to us, don't read**. You may use notes when you make your presentation, but you may not read from a fully written out text.
* **Do plenty of reading and research**, not just from your book, but also the broader context of the book. Take notes!
* **Discuss your presentation topic with others** as you plan the presentation in its general outlines.
* **Brainstorm** and write down all the interesting ideas that have come from the book.
  * Try to write down as many as possible so you can choose the most interesting ones
* **Organize** your ideas into a coherent sequence that tells a story
  * This should be *your* story, not the exact same story as the book!
* Add an introduction, which tells what you will talk about, and a conclusion which sums up what you have discussed and learned.
* Meet with classmates, TAs, and/or the instructor to organize and **polish the presentation**.
* Visualize yourself giving a talk to the class, going through all these ideas, in a comfortable and relaxed fashion.
  * It can be helpful to practice giving the presentation to friend and/or in a mirror.

If you follow the guidlines above, you'll be in great shape to give your presentation to the class.

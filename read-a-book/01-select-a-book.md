# Select a Book to Read!
## Read a Book, Part 1 of 5

Based on the intake survey from the first day of class, almost half of you (45%) have not read a book in 2025.

If all goes well, we are going to get that number down to 0%!

But nobody is going to tell you what to read -- **you must choose which book to read.**

The requirements are pretty loose:
* The book must be related to technology and society
* It must be a book you have not read before
* There are no formal criteria for length, genre, language, etc.

## What to turn in for this part
To receive full credit for Part 1, complete the Gradescope assignment called "Book Selection," which includes five questions:
1. Which book did you choose?
2. Who wrote the book?
3. How long is the book?
4. How did you learn about the book?
5. What is one thing you want to learn from reading this book?
6. Give two additional reasons why this book seems interesting to you.

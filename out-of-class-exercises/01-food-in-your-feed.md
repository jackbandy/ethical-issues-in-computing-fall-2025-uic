# The "Food" in your "Feed" (Media Diary Worksheet)

In this exercise, students collect data from an algorithmic feed as a starting point for class discussion and reflection.
This is essentially a guided media diary, with the following table provided.
Students are encouraged to use the final column to collect additional information (e.g. number of likes, account follower count).

# Digital Trace Rag Doll

Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and especially [Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/), companies now provide various ways to access the data they hold about us. This is often an option buried in the privacy settings menu somewhere and titled "export my data," "data export request," "download my profile," or something like that.

*The purpose of this exercise is to retrieve and meditate on these data, guided by the metaphor of a "digital rag doll."*


## Part 1: Collect Personal Trace Data

First, retrieve some of the data these companies have about you. You can choose one of the options below, or another app you use that offers this feature.

**Note**: many companies take a few days to actually send you the data, so try to request the data a few days before you plan to make the doll.

## Part 2: Review Trace Data

Spend some time reviewing the data. It should be fairly straightforward to bring it into a structured data analysis library (i.e. Pandas) if you were given a [CSV](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#) or [JSON](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.read_json.html). This can be useful for getting some interesting lifetime stats, such as:
* How many total TikToks have I watched?
* How many total posts have I liked on Instagram?
* Which accounts have I engaged with the most?
* How many comments have I posted?
* How many hours of YouTube videos have I watched?

In addition to these quantitative questions, consider the substance represented in the data. Guiding questions might be:
* If someone only had this data about a person, what would they infer about that person?
* Which advertisers might try to reach a person with this kind of data?
* Which data represent me accurately? Inaccurately? Unsure?
* Does this data capture specific time periods with more or less accuracy?
* How much of this data would I feel comfortable sharing more broadly?


## Part 3: Make a Doll
Yes, an actual doll! Consider your observations from part 2 and the essence that is captured by the digital trace data. Remember to consider how the data were created, what they include, what they exclude, and whatever else came up as you reviewed the data. Although the title of the exercise is "rag doll," the doll can be made of any material you find fitting and/or convenient, for example:
* yarn
* tape
* newspaper
* printer paper
* cans
* cardboard
* aluminum foil
* plastic bags
* paper bags
* wire


## Class Discussion Questions
* What material did you use for your doll, and why?
* How did you capture the data in your doll?
* What elements did you have to leave out of your doll?
* If the rag doll could speak, what would it say?
* If you could collect more data for your rag doll, what would it be? How would that change its appearance?
* How will you shape your digital rag doll in the future?
* How much data were you able to access?
* How usable was the data provided?
* What questions and concerns do you still have?

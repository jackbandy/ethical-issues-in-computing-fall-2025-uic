# Speculative Fiction

The premise for this exercise is simple: **write an episode of Black Mirror**.

The purpose is also simple: practice ethical speculation. Computer Scientists have often failed to consider the potential (and even probable) consequences of technology, leaving many people asking, "why didn't they see that coming?" For example, in 2016 Microsoft's [infamous Tay chatbot](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/internet-ethics/resources/-learning-from-tays-encounter-with-social-media/), was [taken offline](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/25/learning-tays-introduction/) after it started generating offensive content. More recently, OpenAI somehow [did not expect "copyright drama"](https://archive.ph/20251009154843/https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/795171/openai-devday-sam-altman-sora-launch-copyright) after the release of Sora 2, and quickly had to change their policies. A bit of foresight and ethical speculation might have prevented these issues.

**Note**: This exercise was developed from Casey Fiesler's ["Black Mirror Writers Room"](https://medium.com/cuinfoscience/the-black-mirror-writers-room-the-case-and-caution-for-ethical-speculation-in-cs-education-5c81d05d2c67) assignment, which has been detailed in [this 2022 SIGCSE paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3478431.3499308).

If you have not seen Black Mirror or you want a brief refresher for inspirational purposes, consider the following samples (which come from my favorite episodes of the show):
* This [scene from Nosedive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrpK90bHO2U), with a social rating system that dictates where you can go and what you can buy.
* This [TV trailer for "The Entire History of You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bFCqK81s7Y), an episode premised on a memory implant device that records / replays anything you see and hear
* This [official trailer for U.S.S. Callister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgTtyfgzGc0), in which a programmer creates a VR game to use as a coping mechanism.
* This [trailer for "Hang the DJ"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5N_Tq1EtRQ), featuring a dating app that tells people how much time they'll spend together.

## Part 1: Scaffolding
Before you start a story, spend some time thinking about the following components.  

**What and When** (choose a technology and a time period)
* What are some tools or technologies that you expect to see in the next decade or so?
* What are some existing technologies from which you can see specific risks and/or harms in the real world?  

**Why** (consider potential implications)
* What would this technology look like in real-world social situations?
* What kind of regulation might (seek to) address this technology?  

**Who** (describe the people)
* Describe a fictional person or group of people who might interact with the technology.
* Describe the risks and/or changes these people might experience.


## Part 2: Writing
Now write the story! It must be longer than one page (i.e. at least two pages, although page two can be short), double-spaced, with 12pt font. The story will be graded for completion, as I am encouraging you to activate your imagination and enjoy the writing process.

## Part 3: Promotional Slide
Finally, use [the templates in these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EznTXuwHykVb_PGJaNpEewgeQ3KMvRlvLSjepsB2BZc/edit?usp=sharing) to create a promotional slide for your episode. Specifically, be sure to (1) choose a title, (2) write a log line for the episode, and (3) take a photo that goes with the story you wrote.

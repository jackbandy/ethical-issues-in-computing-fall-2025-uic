# Speculative Fiction

This assignment was developed from Casey Fiesler's ["Black Mirror Writers Room"](https://medium.com/cuinfoscience/the-black-mirror-writers-room-the-case-and-caution-for-ethical-speculation-in-cs-education-5c81d05d2c67) exercise, which has been detailed in [this 2022 SIGCSE paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3478431.3499308).

The premise is simple: write a pitch for an episode of Black Mirror, based on a 

If you have not seen Black Mirror or you want a brief refresher for inspirational purposes, consider watching:
* This [trailer for "Hang the DJ"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5N_Tq1EtRQ), featuring a dating app that tells people how much time they'll spend together.
* This [scene from Nosedive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrpK90bHO2U), with a social rating system that dictates where you can go and what you can buy
* This [TV trailer for "The Entire History of You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bFCqK81s7Y), an episode premised on a memory implant device that records / replays anything you see and hear
* This [official trailer for U.S.S. Callister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgTtyfgzGc0), in which a programmer creates a VR game to use as a coping mechanism

## Part 1: Scaffolding
Before you start a story, spend some time thinking about the following components.  

**What and When** (choose a technology and a time period)
* What are some tools or technologies that you expect to see in the next decade or so?
* What are some existing technologies from which you can see specific risks and/or harms in the real world?  

**Why** (consider potential implications)
* What would this technology look like in real-world social situations?
* What kind of regulation might (seek to) address this technology?  

**Who** (describe the people)
* Describe a fictional person or group of people who might interact with the technology.
* Describe the risks and/or changes these people might experience.


## Part 2: Writing
Now write the story! It must be at least two pages, double-spaced, with 12pt font. The story will be graded for completion, as I am encouraging you to activate your imagination and enjoy the writing process.

## Part 3: Promotional Slide
Finally, create a promotional slide for your episode. Specifically, be sure to (1) choose a title, (2) write a log line for the episode, and (3) take a photo that goes with the story you wrote.

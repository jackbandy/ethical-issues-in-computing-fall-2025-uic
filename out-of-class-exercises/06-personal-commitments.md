# Personal Commitment

This is your final out-of-class exercise for this class! If we have been (at least somewhat) successful this semester, you will be leaving with a sense of social responsibility. We have talked a lot about acting well in the world -- ethics. At this point, you hopefully have developed "a means and a process for achieving your own moral judgments" ([Callahan 1980](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-3138-4_2), as cited by Computing and Technology Ethics Chapter 1, pg. 5).

To help you take this responsibility into the real world, you will be writing your own personal commitments regarding how you want to act and make decisions. In other words, your personal ethics statement. For this exercise, I am drawing on an assignment I encountered from working with Adam Waytz for his "Ethics and Leadership" class at Kellogg.

There is no length requirement for this exercise, however, the main statements should fit on a page. If you find yourself writing more, consider organizing into "summary" and "explanation" sections.

Here are some guidelines adapted from Adam Waytz's version of this exercise:
* You can think of this as a personal credo or honor code that you are committing to.
* Try to think about principles that you want to be top of mind to guide your decisions.
* Be concrete, specific, and practical.
* Avoid melodramatic or grandiose statements.
* Identify core values, virtues, and character strengths.
* Make it memorable -- simple and sticky!

Although your submission does not need to contain detailed explanations, you should be able to explain the meaning of what you write and why you wrote it as a guideline.

As always, email me with any questions!
